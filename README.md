# CustomersComplaintsClassification
This project is intended to help in analyzing customers complaints sent through Twitter and use machine learning to classify them. 
The tweets data were poped from Twitter API, cleaned, analyzed, classified, and then machine learning models were trained to predict classification of unclassified tweets in order to minimize the time & effort spent on delivering the complaint to the right staff.
